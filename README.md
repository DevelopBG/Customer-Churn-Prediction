# Customer-Churn-Prediction

In this hands-on data science project, we build a complete customer churn prediction model from scratch using Python.


### The project covers:

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🛠 Feature Engineering

🤖 Machine Learning with scikit-learn

🚀 Deployment with Streamlit

Finally, we create an interactive Streamlit app to showcase the model and gain actionable insights into customer churn.
